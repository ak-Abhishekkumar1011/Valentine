# Hi there, I'm Abhishek! 👋 

### 👨‍💻 Creative Developer | UI Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I'm a developer who loves turning complex logic into fun, interactive web experiences. I believe that code should not only work perfectly but also provide a "wow" moment for the user.

## 💖 Featured Project: The ZooZoo Valentine Proposal
I recently built an interactive proposal page inspired by the Vodafone ZooZoo characters.
- **The Magic:** The "No" button uses a **velocity-tracking algorithm**—the faster you move your mouse, the further it flies away!
- **The Logic:** As you try to click "No," the "Yes" button grows bigger and bigger, making the choice inevitable. ;)
- **Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript, and Canvas-Confetti.
